## 🔄 **Order Lifecycle & Status Flow**

### **Complete Order Workflow:**
1. **`booked`** → Client books gig, payment processed
2. **`accepted`** → Student accepts the order  
3. **`in_progress`** → Student starts working
4. **`in_review`** → Student submits delivery
5. **`completed`** → Client accepts delivery OR **`revision_requested`** → back to step 3
6. **Alternative**: **`cancelled`** → Either party cancels

### **Role-Based Status Transitions:**
- **Student Actions**: `booked` → `accepted` → `in_progress` → `in_review` (via delivery)
- **Client Actions**: `in_review` → `completed` OR `in_review` → `revision_requested`  
- **Admin Actions**: Can override any status change
